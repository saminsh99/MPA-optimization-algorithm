# MPA-optimization-algorithm
The Marine Predator Algorithm (MPA) is an optimization algorithm inspired by the behavior of prey and predators in marine ecosystems
This algorithm is designed to solve complex optimization problems by mimicking the strategies used by predators in marine ecosystems to find food or prey. The algorithm consists of a population of individuals, called hunters, who are potential solutions to check for optimization. Each predator in the population is associated with a fitness value that indicates its quality as a solution. One of the strengths of MPA is its ability to solve dynamic and challenging problems in terms of density and adjustment of optimal points, which is possible due to the variability and adaptability of the algorithm parameters. This article investigates the performance of this algorithm in various problems, as well as its disadvantages and usage, and also compares MPA with other optimization algorithms..
